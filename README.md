# Docker Commands

Docker Commands was built to simplify the Docker learning curve for a developer or an IT team.
Just symlink the shell script to your /usr/local/bin and you should be able to use it from anywhere on your host (or VM).

    ln -sfn docker-commands.sh /usr/local/bin/docker-commands.sh
    
    then use it with . docker-commands.sh from anywhere

The shell script build-docker-image.sh could be copied in your projects folder, in a docker sub-folder. This one will help
automate build, tag and push to your repository with interactive prompt. You can execute it directly with
sh build-docker-image.sh or simply execute it from the docker command #10
