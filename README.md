# Docker Commands

Docker COmmands was built to simplify the Docker learning curve for a dev or an IT team.
Just symlink the shell script to your /usr/local/bin and you should be able to use it from any project directory.

    ln -sfn docker-commands.sh /usr/local/bin/docker-commands.sh

The shell script build-docker-image.sh should be copied in your projects, in a docker folder. This one will help
automate build, tag and push to your repository with interactive prompt. You can execute it directly with
sh build-docker-image.sh or simply execute it from the docker command #10
